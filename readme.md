## Project Overview

**The Neighbourhood Nook** website features a welcoming design for a small restaurant. It has sections like the homepage, menu, gallery, and contact information. This project was developed as part of a group challenge for the bootcamp, but only Niklas’s branch was successfully merged into the final version due to scheduling and communication issues.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A friendly welcome section with big header images.
- **About Us**: An introduction to the restaurant and its atmosphere.
- **Menu**: Placeholder text describing the menu items.
- **Gallery**: Pictures of food to attract visitors.
- **Contact Information**: The restaurant's address and links to social media.


## Challenges

Collaboration and Merging

This project was made by Niklas and Mutsa. However, due to scheduling conflicts and communication breakdowns, **Mutsa’s branch was not merged into the main**. As a result, the current live version only shows **Niklas’s contributions**. This situation highlights the need for better teamwork and communication in group projects.


## Project Structure

The current structure reflects Niklas’ work, but could potentially include additional files or sections from Mutsa’s branch in future versions.

```
├── index.html         # Main homepage
├── styles.css         # Main CSS stylesheet
├── img/               # Images used in the website
├── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Future Improvements

- **Merge Mutsa's Work**: Review and add the extra content from **Student 2** into the main project.
- **Complete the Content**: Replace placeholder text with final details, especially for the menu and contact sections.
- **Improve Accessibility**: Make the site easier for everyone to use, including people with disabilities, by using semantic elements.
